Analysis procedure for MPPC data.

Instructions how to use it:

First the user should setup the parameters.txt file which has:
20120307 (the date data was taken)
003 (run number)
20 (temperature)
/lustre/atlas/hayk (the location to save the output)
0.9 (the shift from the break down voltage to get the operational point)
1 (high voltage index one wants to get results)
9 (low voltage index one wants to get results)

after that run this sequence:
read_data/read_data (only once) (15 minutes)
./fitNofit (6 minutes)
./presentation/plot (1 minute)

the output in the case of parameter setup above should appear hear:
/lustre/atlas/hayk/20120307/T20/

outputs per scripts:
read_data/read_data:
gaussian_fit.root (with simple histograms with all positions and pins)

./fitNofit:
gaussian_fit_MPPC_"position".root (histograms with found peaks )
gain_vs_volt_pos"position"_pin"pin".gif (gain vs. voltage plot to get
the break down voltage for each position and pin)
lambda_vs_volt_pos"position"_pin"pin".gif (average number of
photo-electrons vs. voltage)
BreakDownVolatge_MPPC_"position".txt (with general output)
results_MPPC_"position".txt (with concise output which include only
measurements at operational point).

./presentation/plot:
gain_voltage_"position".gif
phe_dr_ct_"position".gif
(final plots at operational point)
